        <h1>FAQ</h1><br>
        
        <b>Q:Can this break my printer?<br></b>
        A:Nope, extremely unlikely. You can always revert back to the <a href="https://github.com/garychen99/Duplicator-i3-plus">original firmware</a>.<br><br>
        
        <b>Q:I am using the Cocoon Create Touch/Maker Select Plus can i use this firmware?<br></b>
        A:Yes you can. But since neither Cocoon nor Maker Select have made their firmware public yet, you can't revert back to the original firmware :/<br/>
        You could always flash the official wanhao firmware. It has different menu layouts though.<br>
        I've already contacted Cocoon and Maker Select.<br>Cocoon told me that they would release it soon, but have yet to do so.<br> Maker Select just didnt respond at all.<br>
        So if you have interest, contact them to let them know the community has a demand for the firmware!
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Q:Why doesn't this firmware have motor and pid settings?<br></b>
        A:This firmware has auto pid tuning built in so you dont need to change pid manually.<br>Anyone who wants to modify the motor settings should already know how to do it.<br> I removed the menu cause i felt it was unnecessary and wasted screen space.
